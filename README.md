# WebCrawler Project
A web spider program to crawl links from a given website. This project was part of my Data Structures class, with the aim of developing a multi threaded spider using concurrent data structures

# Calculate reading time of each article
I use Jsoup library to extract article's content to calculate reading time (reading speed for an average adult is 225 wpm) and get the title.
When run: user paste in the article's URL to start the multi-threaded spider

# Detect broken links
If the link is broken, the program will output to inform the user which hyperlinked text has a broken link.
